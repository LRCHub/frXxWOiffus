Let's pray for my sweet children
We sing them in our songs
Let's try to get along

Burn, rape, and kill the village
They had to have it all
We choke on the exhaust

We are innocent living in the prison
We are innocent living in the prison of stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers

Stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers

Let's pray for my sweet children
They're trying to build a wall, but that won't help at all
For women, dogs, and children
I finally said it all
Let's sing them in a song

We are innocents living in a prison
We are innocents living in the prison of stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers

Stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers

All I know is the days have come and gone
All I know is the days have come in stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers

Stress
Anxiety
Fear
These are shallow graves for losers
